Our story began in 2005, when two lifelong friends and entrepreneurs, driven by their passion for travel, launched Agoda to make it easier for everyone to explore the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, we are part of Booking Holdings [NASDAQ: BKNG], with a diverse team of over 7,000 people from 90 countries, working together in offices around the globe. Every day, we connect people to destinations and experiences, with our great deals across our millions of hotels and holiday properties, flights, and experiences worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No two days are the same at Agoda. Data and technology are at the heart of our culture, fueling our curiosity and innovation.

Travelers chose Agoda because they are confident that they can find there the best hotels, at the best price.

To this end, we are looking for a senior leader to craft Agodaâs global marketing strategy and execute upon it, using a wide range of tactics and tools, from price display to machine learning algorithms.

    <description>&lt;strong&gt;About Agoda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;At Agoda, we bridge the world through travel. Our story began in 2005, when two lifelong friends and entrepreneurs, driven by their passion for travel, launched Agoda to make it easier for everyone to explore the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, we are part of Booking Holdings [NASDAQ: BKNG], with a diverse team of over 7,000 people from 90 countries, working together in offices around the globe. Every day, we connect people to destinations and experiences, with our great deals across our millions of hotels and holiday properties, flights, and experiences worldwide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No two days are the same at Agoda. Data and technology are at the heart of our culture, fueling our curiosity and innovation. If youâre ready to begin your best journey and help build travel for the world, join us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In the online travel industry, with fast changing user behavior and the increasing role played by price comparison websites, offering the best price grants disproportionate gains. Travelers chose Agoda because they are confident that they can find there the best hotels, at the best price. Success can only be achieved by combining a programmatic approach to optimize volumes and margins in the short term with a strategic approach to take into account the reactions from the other players in the game, from customers to hotels, from competitors to regulatory bodies. To this end, we are looking for a senior leader to craft Agodaâs global marketing strategy and execute upon it, using a wide range of tactics and tools, from price display to machine learning algorithms. You will closely coordinate with Agodaâs senior management, marketing and product teams, while managing and expanding a team of talented pricing campaign managers and analysts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you will be doing:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strategy Development: Develop and refine PPC strategy in line with overall business goals and market trends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance Management: Monitor channel performance and efficiency (ROI, spend, and other key KPIs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stakeholder Communication: Regularly communicate performance, insights, and recommendations to senior leadership and cross-functional teams.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Process Improvement: Identify and implement process improvements to increase team efficiency and campaign effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vendor/Partner Management: Manage relationships with external partners (e.g., Google, Bing, agencies) and negotiate contracts or terms as needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talent Development: Mentor, train, and develop team members to build skills and support career growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Innovation &amp;amp; Experimentation: Foster a culture of testing and innovation, encouraging the team to explore new channels, tools, and bidding strategies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Insights: Analyze and explore data to seed projects, understand test performance, and execute on key team goals that require complex implementation or analysis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you need to be good at to succeed in this role:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical skills and a passion for working with data to drive business decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Advance proficiency in SQL&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience in the online travel or e-commerce industry is a plus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proven ability to collaborate effectively across teams and cultures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People management experience, including hiring, coaching, and developing team members.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience managing budgets and delivering results against financial targets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A proactive, entrepreneurial mindset with a strong sense of ownership and a get-things-done attitude.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exposure to product development, technology, or working with IT teams is an advantage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#Bengaluru #SÃ£oPaulo #Delhi #NewYorkCity #Nigeria #London #Hyderabad #Pune #Mumbai #Colombia #Paris #Jakarta #Chennai #SanFrancisco #WashingtonDC #Toronto #Pakistan #LosAngeles #Dallas #Chicago #Kenya #Boston #Shanghai #Egypt #BuenosAires #Manila #Netherlands #Singapore #RiodeJaneiro #Beijing #Atlanta #Sydney #Madrid #Vietnam #SaudiArabia #Peru #Melbourne #Ireland #Russia #Bangladesh #MexicoCity #Philadelphia #Chile #SeattleArea #Noida #Kolkata #Guangdong #UnitedArabEmirates #TelAvivDistrict #Houston #KualaLumpur #BeloHorizonte #SouthKorea #Bangkok #Istanbul #Austin #Curitiba #Warsaw #Campinas #Barcelona #Ukraine #CostaRica #Berlin #Romania #Denver #Johannesburg #Minneapolis #Manchester #Miami #Phoenix #Detroit #Coimbatore #Milan #PortoAlegre #Vancouver #Montreal #Charlotte #SanDiego #Ghana #SaltLakeCity #Raleigh #HongKong #Munich #Prague #Ecuador #TampaBay #Tokyo #Serbia  #Taipei #Cracow #Zhejiang #CapeTown #Brasilia #Columbus #Ahmedabad #Indore #Kochi #Gurgaon #Chandigarh #Lucknow #Bhubaneswar #Thiruvananthapuram #Visakhapatnam #Bhopal #JerseyCity #Irving #Denton #Worcester #Arlington #OverlandPark #AuroraDistrict #Baltimore #Tampa #Halethorpe #Dayton #Syracuse #Chonburi #ChiangMai #NakhonRatchasima #KhonKaen #HatYai #Phuket #Surabaya #Tangerang #Birmingham #Casablanca #Rabat #Camp #PetalingJaya #GeorgeTown &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discover More About Working At Agoda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Agoda Careers https://careersatagoda.com&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Facebook https://www.facebook.com/agodacareers/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/company/agoda&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;YouTube https://www.youtube.com/agodalife&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equal Opportunity Employer &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;At Agoda, we pride ourselves on being a company represented by people of all different backgrounds and orientations.
